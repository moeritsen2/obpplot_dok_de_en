========

If this documentation was helpful to you, we would be delighted if you would support us with a donation. We have put a lot of voluntary work and energy into the project in order to be able to offer it in a high-quality form. Your donation is an appreciation of our work. We see it as our duty to follow the principles of open source, open hardware and open data. We therefore make our knowledge available to the general public free of charge. With your help, we can publish more interesting projects. You also help to ensure that this site continues to be available to the general public free of charge.
