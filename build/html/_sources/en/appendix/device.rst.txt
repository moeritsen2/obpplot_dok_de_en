DIY-Possibilities
=================

Customisation of the plotter for individual applications is described in this section.
This relates to the hardware of the device by using additional circuit boards or alternative housing parts.
In addition, other software can also be used, such as alternative operating systems like Raspbian or other navigation software like OpenCPN etc.
