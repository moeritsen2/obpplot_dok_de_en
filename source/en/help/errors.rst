Known Errors
============

Known bugs that have not yet been fixed are listed here. In addition, there is a project page for the firmware and hardware at Github, in which a bug tracking system is implemented. If you want to view reported and fixed bugs, go to the **Issues** section or look in the respective areas below.

There you can search for errors and view the error descriptions and their solutions. You can also use the **Issues** section to report bugs that are not yet included in the system. Please describe as precisely as possible in English the circumstances under which the error occurs. The error must be comprehensible to us, only then can it be rectified. If you have any tips on how things can be improved or if you miss certain functions, we would like to ask you to report these as well.

We prefer this type of error tracking as it allows us to rectify errors quickly and in a structured manner. This system allows us to work with several employees at locations around the world to rectify errors. With your support, this enables us to provide high-quality software and hardware.

Critical errors
---------------

Critical errors are serious errors that significantly impair the function of the device or prevent the execution of an important function.


Software error
--------------

Software errors are errors within the software. A function is faulty under certain circumstances or is missing altogether. The errors are not critical.


Hardware error
--------------

Hardware errors are caused by the hardware. These can be, for example, design errors on a circuit board or, in individual cases, incorrectly assembled circuit boards. The design of the device or the material selection of individual components can also be affected. The errors are not critical.


Fixed bugs
----------

Fixed bug have been solved. When errors occur, it is also worth looking at the fixed errors, as workarounds are sometimes provided to eliminate the errors.

Software extensions
-------------------

Software enhancements are suggestions for improving the software or extending the functionality of the device.


New display pages
------------------
