Service
=======

Our basic idea is that the open project description and documentation should enable everyone to help themselves technically. In addition to the documentation, the project websites and research on the Internet, there are many other sources of information for gaining knowledge. We also have a strong community through the `Sailing Forum`_, which can help you with questions if you don`t know what to do yourself. First and foremost, however, you should try to solve technical problems yourself. In some cases this will not always be possible, for example if you do not have the necessary tools. We can provide a limited number of hardware repair services on a voluntary basis through Open Boat Projects. However, please bear in mind that this work takes up some of our free time and therefore cannot always be carried out promptly. And of course, in such cases we are always happy to receive a small, appropriate donation so that we can realise further projects for the community.
